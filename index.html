<h2>Information Security</h2>
  
    <p>Information security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks.</p>
<p>This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process that involves:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>identifying information and related assets, plus potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>evaluating the risks;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>deciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>where risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>monitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes, and improvement opportunities.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
